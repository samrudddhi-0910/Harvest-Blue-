      <p>
        <strong>What is SDG 6?</strong> — SDG 6 is the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal that aims to “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” by 2030. It covers targets on safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, hygiene, wastewater treatment, water-use efficiency, integrated water resources management, and international cooperation on water-related activities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why it matters</strong> — Access to safe water and sanitation is a foundation for health, education, and gender equality. Lack of safe water contributes to disease burden, reduces school attendance (especially for girls), and increases time poverty for caregivers who must fetch water. Meeting SDG 6 brings immediate health benefits and strengthens resilience against droughts and floods.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How rainwater harvesting and Harvest Blue link to SDG 6</strong> — Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a practical and often low-cost component of SDG 6 interventions. By capturing and safely storing rainfall from rooftops and catchments, RWH reduces dependence on distant or contaminated sources, supplements household and institutional supply during dry months, and can be combined with simple treatment or first-flush diversion to improve water safety. RWH also supports groundwater recharge where designed for infiltration, contributing to sustainable water resource management.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across our projects, RWH is paired with sanitation and hygiene training — this integrated approach increases uptake, reduces disease transmission, and creates demonstration sites that encourage broader community adoption. For detailed global indicators and progress on SDG 6, refer to the United Nations SDG 6 overview and the WHO/UNICEF JMP monitoring pages linked from our home page.

      <!-- Additional Content -->
      <h2>Targets of SDG 6</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.</li>
        <li>Ensure access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation.</li>
        <li>Improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals.</li>
        <li>Increase water-use efficiency across all sectors to ensure sustainable water withdrawals.</li>
        <li>Implement integrated water resources management at all levels.</li>
        <li>Protect and restore water-related ecosystems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Harvest Blue Contributions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Installation of rainwater harvesting systems in schools and communities.</li>
        <li>Construction of safe latrines and handwashing stations in school compounds.</li>
        <li>Community workshops on hygiene, sanitation, and sustainable water management.</li>
        <li>Monitoring and promoting water efficiency and conservation practices in local communities.</li>
        <li>Engaging students in hands-on projects to understand the importance of clean water and hygiene.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Everyone Should Care</h2>
      <p>
        Access to clean water and proper sanitation is a fundamental human right. SDG 6 directly impacts health, education, gender equality, and economic development. Supporting local initiatives, understanding water management, and adopting simple water-saving practices at home contribute to a global movement towards sustainability and resilience.
